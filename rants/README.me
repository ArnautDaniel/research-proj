Some greek guy once said "if you wanna be a boat builder, build boats" and I can't be arsed to go look him up right now.  But  this is what this part of the repo is about.  The way I see it, if I want to organize my philosophy on computer programming the only way to do that is to write about it.  I make no promises on it being a good exposition, but it will be something.  Starting off with the first one I've written in the hopes that more will come.  A type of public introspection? I guess that's just blogging again.
