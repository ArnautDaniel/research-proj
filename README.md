# research-proj

This repo will be for projects that I haven't had time to work on but just so I don't lose my rambling notes I'm going to keep them all organized up here.

So far I think it's just: Ziggy and the 12Labors project.  I like to work in an iterative way so if you do actually read them for some reason just know that there's probably some blantantly wrong stuff in there that I am aware of but am still trying to work out the solution too.

At the least it's fun to work on the design aspect of things sometimes.
